## About

Simple way to convert a Webflow site with Webflow components into a Bootstrap-themed website.

**Do you:**

- prefer Bootstrap's default design over Webflow?
- just want to quickly launch a minimal site without worrying much about styling individual components
- want a 1140px-width Bootstrap container / or dislike the default 940px max-width Webflow container?
- find it difficult to use dropdowns in the Webflow navbar?
- etc...


## Demo

_Compare how your site could look before and after using this_

**Before:** [http://webflow-bootstrap-before.webflow.io](http://webflow-bootstrap-before.webflow.io)  
**After:** [http://webflow-bootstrap.webflow.io](http://webflow-bootstrap.webflow.io)


## Instructions

1. Use the instructions on [this forum thread](https://forum.webflow.com/t/how-to-embed-files-hosted-on-github/29281?u=samliew) to insert the script file [webflow-bootstrap.js](https://github.com/samliew/webflow-bootstrap/blob/master/webflow-bootstrap.js), into your project's *Site Settings > Footer Code*.
